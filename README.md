# github-action-test
Small test repo to tinker with github actions.

This repo is a mere personal proof-of-concept for using GitHub Actions to automate something and interact with the repo. 

The only thing happening is a job run at approximately midnight, appending a timestamp to a text file. It is neither polished or optimized, but it works. The project's commit history serves as a cautionary tale of failure and non-understanding, but ultimately success (somewhat).
